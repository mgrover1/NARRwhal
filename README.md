# NARRwhal
Ever need to generate a bunch of maps for a case study? Is that case study sometime since 1979? Then this thing can probably help!
This program has a convenient GUI interface with drop-down menus that can be used to create maps from the NARR reanalysis dataset for 
any date since 1979. It has been quite helpful for various case study projects here at Valpo.

For the "winter" setting, the plotter will make 300,500, and 850mb maps with wind, height, and temperatures, surface charts, and 500mb vorticity maps.
For the "severe" setting, it will also plot maps of sfc-500mb and sfc-850mb shear, supercell composite and sfc-500mb crossover, and a map with surface CAPE and 0-3km SRH.
